== Quota Reload and Graceful Restart
* To **reload quota files** just send **SIGHUP** to process or Docker container:
+
```
# kill -HUP <pid>
# docker kill -s HUP <container-id-or-name>
```
+
NOTE: Use only one of these commands depending on whether you have Docker installed.
* To **gracefully restart** (without losing connections) send **SIGUSR2**:
+
```
# kill -USR2 <pid>
# docker kill -s USR2 <container-id-or-name>
```
